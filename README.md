# Stickify.js

## Overview

**Stickify.js** is a modern JavaScript framework designed to decouple business logic from the UI, enabling a cleaner and more modular development experience. By focusing on a declarative approach to binding and platform-agnostic integration, it empowers developers to create scalable, testable, and reusable business logic layers that seamlessly integrate with a variety of UI libraries and frameworks.

## Key Features

- **Platform-Agnostic Logic Execution**
  Write business logic that can run independently of the UI, whether in a browser, Node.js, or other JavaScript runtime environments.

- **Seamless UI Integration via Adapters**
  The framework uses adapters to integrate with modern UI solutions such as React, Next.js, Vue, Vite, WebComponents, or even static HTML pages.

- **Declarative Binding**
  A declarative binding mechanism ensures that the UI reflects the state of the business logic automatically, simplifying data flow and minimizing boilerplate.

- **Standalone Business Logic Bundling**
  Business logic can be packaged as an independent JavaScript bundle, enabling reusability across multiple projects and platforms.

- **Static Page Compatibility**
  Stickify.js can be integrated into static HTML pages, making it suitable for lightweight applications or progressive enhancement scenarios.

- **Console-Executable Logic**
  Business logic is entirely decoupled from the UI, enabling it to be executed and tested directly in the console or through automated test suites.

- **Extensibility through Adapters**
  The frameworkâ€™s adapter mechanism allows developers to extend its capabilities and tailor it to meet specific integration requirements or platform constraints.

## Use Cases

- Building UI-agnostic logic for reusable enterprise-grade applications.
- Sharing the same business logic across web, mobile, and server-side applications.
- Simplifying the testing of business rules by isolating them from the UI layer.
- Enhancing legacy projects with modern declarative bindings and state management without a full-stack rewrite.
